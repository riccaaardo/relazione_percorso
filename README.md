# Project Steps

- Installed Llama tools and created a Python script to interact with the model (see `test.py`);
- Created a Python script to generate a graph and its related colors (see `graphGeneratorTest.py`);
- Wrote a draft template prompt (see `template.txt`);
- Developed an ASP solver for the graph colorability problem (see `colourability.lp`).

## TODO:
- Write a script to inject the data generated by `graphGeneratorTest.py` into the template (Implement with a grammar? Maybe later...);
- Create a script that takes the generated templates and feeds them to the model;
- Verify whether the generated facts make sense and feed them to the solver (no quick fixes yet!).
