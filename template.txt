Given a graph with $N_NODES nodes, the following colors: $COLORS
and the following edges that compose the graph: $EDGES,
exctract information as "facts" based on the following example:

INPUT:
Given a graph with 4 nodes, the following colors: red, blue
and the following edges that compose the graph: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3),
extract information.

OUTPUT:
n_nodes(4).
colors(red, blue).
edges((0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3))
